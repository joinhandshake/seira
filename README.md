# Seira

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/seira.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/seira)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joinhandshake/seira.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/github/joinhandshake/seira)

An opinionated library for building applications on Kubernetes.

This library builds a framework for doing deployments, secrets management, managing and accessing pods, bootstraping new apps and clusters, and more. It makes decisions about how to run the apps and cluster to make managing the cluster easier.

The vision for Seira is to produce a CLI and set of guidelines that makes deploying apps on Kubernetes as easy as Heroku.

## What does the name mean?

Following Kubernetes naming pattern, Seira (Seir√°) is greek for "order" or "the state of being well arranged".

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'seira'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install seira

The `gem install seira` option may be preferred for shorter typing, or generating a binstub is also an option.

## Usage

This library only currently works with `gcloud` and `kubectl`, meaning Google Cloud Platform and Kubernetes.

All commands follow a pattern:

`seira <cluster> <app> <category> <param1> <param2> <..>`

The only exception is commands on the cluster itself, which does not take an `<app>`. By making sure to take in a cluster as the first parameter to every command, the intent is to reduce mistake commands on the wrong cluster.

### Configuration File

A configuration file is expected at `.seira.yml` relative path. Below is an example file.

```
seira:
  organization_id: "11111"
  clusters:
    internal:
      project: org-internal
      cluster: gke_org-internal_us-central1-a_internal
      region: us-central1
      zone: us-central1-b
      aliases:
        - "i"
    staging:
      project: org-staging
      cluster: gke_org-staging_us-central1-a_staging
      region: us-central1
      aliases:
        - "s"
    demo:
      project: org-demo
      cluster: gke_org-demo_us-central1-a_demo
      region: us-central1
      aliases:
        - "d"
    production:
      project: org-production
      cluster: gke_org-production_us-central1-a_production
      region: us-central1
      aliases:
        - "p"
  applications:
    - name: app1
      golden_tier: "web"
    - name: app2
      golden_tier: "web"
```

This specification is read in and used to determine what `gcloud` context to use and what `kubectl` cluster to use when operating commands. For example, `seira internal` will connect to `org-internal` gcloud configuration and `gke_org-internal_us-central1-a_internal` kubectl cluster. For shorthand, `seira i` shorthand is specified as an alias.

### Application Configuration Files

Each app can also define configuration files. These files specify details that allow seira to execute commands with minimal user input, and declare aspects of the application. This file lives in the app folder with the name `.seira.app.yaml`. An example configuration file:

```
# The name of the sql instance as it shows in GCP Cloud SQL UI
primary_sql_instance: app-database-name
```

### Regions and Zones

All clusters should have a `region` option specified. For zonal clusters (clusters that are NOT regional) should also specify their `zone`.

### Manifest Files

Seira expects your Kubernetes manifests to exist in the "kubernetes/cluster-name/app-name" directory. When a deploy is run on `foo` app in `staging` cluster, it looks to `kubernetes/staging/foo` directory for the manifest files.

### Assumptions

- Each app has all its objects contained in a namespace, named after the app
- Each app has one or more deployments, and a deployment and all pods created by that deployment have a `tier` label matching the name of the deployment
- If using a SQL database (currently only postgresql is supported), pgbouncer is used for connection pooling, and the app uses the secret `DATABASE_URL` to connect and authenticate to the database

### Initial Setup

In order to use Seira, an initial setup is needed. Use the `seira setup` command to set up each of your clusters in your configuration file.

## Current Functionality

All functionality is targeted to be a platform on top of Kubernetes that has a Heroku-like experience.

### App

* Bootstrap new applications
* Apply new configurations to an application
* Scale app tiers
* Restart an application

### Database (Postgres)

* List postgres instances
* Create new primary and automatically set the right secrets with configurability such as HA, CPU, Memory.
* Create a new replica on the primary
* Pgbouncer yaml generation for all new instances
* Delete an instance

### Pods

* List pods for a given app
* Connect to a running pod to run commands
* Run a one-off command such as `rails db:migrate`

### Secrets

* List, set, unset secrets

## Example Usage

### Running Proxy UI

Easily run a proxy UI (`kubectl proxy`) by using `seira staging proxy` shorthand.

### Applying New Manifest Files

By using `seira staging app-name app apply`, Seira will find/replace the string "REVISION" in your manifests with the value in the `REVISION` environment variable and apply the new configs to the cluster. If `REVISION` is nil, it will ask to use the tag currently being used by the current `web` deployment.

### Setting Secrets

All secrets are stored in `appname-secrets` Secret object. They are expected to be used via `envFrom` in manifest files.

`seira staging app-name secrets list`

`seira staging app-name secrets set KEY=value`

`seira staging app-name secrets get KEY`

### Pods

Pods can be listed and also exec'd into.

`seira staging app-name pods list`

`seira staging app-name pods connect --pod=<POD-NAME>`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/joinhandshake/seira.

## Roadmap

Future roadmap has plans for:

- Create CLI help commands and improve general CLI usability
- More functionality for managing pods
- More seamless `seira setup` script
